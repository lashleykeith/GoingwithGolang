# GoingwithGolang

## What is the purpose of this project
This is a golang project that is opensource with Golang.  The purpose of this project is to take preexisiting apps written in Python and PHP to turn them into Golang apps.  I first I want to change all the programs that I made in the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Course.  


## How can you contribute
You can find the current app that I need help changing to Golang in the folder `OldCode2BeChanged`.  This app will be written in Python for now but later we might use other languages.  Your role is to take the Python app and rewrite it in Golang.  As people progress in solving this task I will upload the best attempt of this in the folder `SolveThisNow`.  When this attempt is completed I will add it to the `our_tutorial` folder.  That way we will begin to build our codebase in Golang from easy to more complex applications.



## We will be back on May 6
